I used VSCode to run my project. I switched to VSCode instead
ov Visual Studio because it has less files and isn't as bloated
of a project.

Steps to get running on VSCode:

1. Install mingw-w64 here: 
http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download/mingw-builds

2. Make sure to install mingw-w64 just in your c drive.
The path should look identical to this:
C:\\mingw-w64\

3. Once the download is complete and you have downloaded the 
C++ project then in the cmd terminal run this command:
g++ -g -o MazeProject4 MazeProject4.cpp

This command builds the .exe so that you can now run the project.

4. Now in the CMD Terminal make sure to write down the path of the 
.exe file. The path should look something like this:
C:\Users\Isaiah\Desktop\Workspace\CST-201\MazeProject4\MazeProject4.exe

It will be different depending on you where you download the project.
